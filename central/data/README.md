# Server data

This folder stores data collected during camera calibration and ground plane estimation. It will later store the test capture data when one is done.

**DISCLAIMER**: data is *rewritten* if the calibration, ground plane estimation or test capture is done again. Remember to save those into a different directory if you want to keep the full dataframe of a test capture.
